Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19. 

## Summary
It was a pleasure to discover Helium blockchain, and Flying Wolf looks forward to onborading our devices to Helium!
Officially established in the province of British Columbia, Canada, Flying Wolf (originally registered as Boundary Wolf Holdings Ltd.) is startup company mainly focusing on developing and deploying artifically intelligent IoT products for commercial and residential properties. The core team of Flying Wolf started research and development in 2019. We started customer discovery and prototype testings in 2020, and formally filed for incorporation in 2021. Our prototypes are now deployed in commercial and residential properties in Richmond, Vancouver, and West Vancouver and a few local real estate developers have become our client. 

## Company Information (required)
* What is your company name?
  * Flying Wolf
* How long has the company been in business? 
  *  Flying Wolf is a technology firm dedicated to providing enterprise-level Smart Internet of Things Solutions (AIoT) to real estate developers. The core team has started research and development back in 2019. Customer discovery and prototype testings were initiated in 2020. With the first B2B client being obtained in 2021, the core team filed for official incorporation. 
* What kind of products have you created? (list specific products, include links if possible)
  * As a startup company in collaboration with University of British Columbia, Flying Wolf has been mainly focusing on research and development.
  * All products are at Technology Rediness Level 8 according to the standards of the Government of Canada. This means that the products have been proven to work in their final forms and under expected conditions during developmental testings and evaluations.
  * Products include:
    * Tracker devices based on LoRa, without GPS - tracking pets, valuable belongings, and children.
    * LoRa Gateways - used in enterprise IoT solutions for data receiving and transmission
    * Smart Access systems - used in office settings, already in deployment process for London Plaza, Richmond, BC.
    * Smart Parking lot edge computing gateways - used in commercial parking lot, already in deployment process for London Plaza, Richmond, BC.
* How many have you sold? 
  * ~100 gateways, 5 sets of access systems, 1 set of smart parking lot solution (gateways, routers, and Apps included)
* What brought you to the Helium Network? 
  * Our company has been looking for an appropriate IoT blockchain for onborading our devices.
  * We think Helium Network is beneficial for large-scale IoT projects because coverage using Wi-Fi is unnecessary and expensive in these settings. We appreciate the fact that Helium Network cover large regions while allowing for a decentralized management of end nodes. Using HNT as the currency for connecting end devices to the network and transmitting data is also ideal for the large-scale IoT projects that our company has planned and designed for our clients.

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
  * Yes. We have built LoRa gateways for the smart access control system and the smart parking lot solution. We deployed the prototypes in London Plaza. We have also delivered LoRa gateways to end users.
  * We have delivered LoRa trackers to end users.
* Have you built gateways before? 
  * Yes. We developed the LoRa gateway for the smart access control solution and the smart parking lot solution.
* How many gateways did you make? 
  * We made ~100 gateways for testings. 
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
  * We source our components from Semtech, Qualcomm, Microchip. Our manufacturing partner (Excellent Components Limited) is based in Hongkong and has extensive experience with manufacturing radio hardware products. Our exclusive contract and close relationship with Excellent Components Limited will ensure that our manufacturing is prioritized and completed efficiently with high quality.
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 
  * 10,000 SX1302 per month.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from the Helium Foundation. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives. Details for this will be provided after your application has been submitted on GitHub. 
* Proof of identity will be emailed privately upon request.

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?
  *  We plan on manufacturing 10,000 hotspots per month, per batch. We plan on selling at least 50,000 hotspots within the first six months.
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
  * Having partners who are experienced with hardware manufacturing and international trade, we have already placed orders for ECC608 and SX1302, which we know to have long lead times. Our in-stock components are sufficient to manufacture and fulfill at least 50,000 hotspots.
  * Our financial position is well enough to prepay and preorder for a surplus quantity of the critical components of the hotspots to ensure that we can consistently supply the hotspots to our customers.
  * Being a company focusing on IoT solutions for real estate properties, we have clients who look to preorder bulk quantities and prepay for these hotspots once we pass the audit. This will allow us to have a safe cash flow that will ensure smooth operation for at least 12 months.
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures, getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.) 
  * We are in collaboration with university, which means that our research and projects are eligible for government funding. Additionally, local private investors are already asking to fund our AIoT projects. We are confident about our future cash flow.

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
* Delays and long lead times in the current supply chain due to COVID-19 aftermath are the most immediate challenge. Our partnering manufacture has extensive connections and experiences. We also preorder important components of the hotspots far in advance in order to ensure our manufacturing is not affected heavily by changes in supply chain.

## Payment methods available (required):
* Credit card, Mastercard, PayPal, BTC, ETC, Wire Transfer
