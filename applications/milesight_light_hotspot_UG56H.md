## Hardware Security Element 

Milesight Light Hotspots have embedded the encrypt chip [ECC608B](http://resource.milesight-iot.com/files/ATECC608B-CryptoAuthentication-Device-Summary-Data-Sheet-DS40002239A.pdf) on the board to store and secure the swarm_key.

Milesight UG56H use Rockchip on-chip Secure Boot Solution([Rockchip Secure Boot Application Note](http://resource.milesight-iot.com/files/Rockchip-Secure-Boot-Application-Note-V1.9.pdf)) to provide hardware level security protection from unsigned software. In Rockchip Secure Boot Solution, a device specific random 256-bit private key is fused to an one-time programmable memory IP core called eFuse([Rockchip Secure Boot Application Note](http://resource.milesight-iot.com/files/Rockchip-Secure-Boot-Application-Note-V1.9.pdf)-Page 21 6.5) in each SOC at manufacturing time, this key is unreadable and can only be used by eFuse for firmware verification through OTP([Rockchip Secure Boot Application Note](http://resource.milesight-iot.com/files/Rockchip-Secure-Boot-Application-Note-V1.9.pdf)-Page 6).

Every time when the gateway is powered on, Rockchip Secure Boot will verify whether the bootloader and the firmware's signature matches by the burned key inside the SoC before proceed or stop. When try to upgrade or downgrade the firmware, the Rockchip Secure Boot will act the same behavior in SoC before load it or refuse it. The bootloader itself cannot be modified (locked and signed).
