# Aitek Inc
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary
Helium is a pioneer in building a global IoT network, with huge potential and value. With our professional competence and production capacity, we aim to help expand the coverage range through building Helium gateways: connecting consumers, businesses, and developers. We will uphold the Helium values and strike to bring the best products and services to #ThePeople.

## Company Information
Aitek Inc, founded in Dedham, Massachusetts, is a company with a compound business model, channeling solutions for modern demands of high technology. We have many resources, which can be used to design, optimize, and manufacture our products. Our founder who also founded Authright Inc, a company specialized in cyber security, is backing up our project by providing consulting and support. Well connected with our business partners/friends in the industry, we can provide and power up a complete supply chain. Not only with software security and application but also involved with chip design and optimization, which resulted in overall improvement of manufacturing and sales.

## Product Information

Aitek Miner Light hotspot is a LoRa gateway device for the Helium network. We make both Full hotspot and Light hotspot gateway(under R&D), and this is the application and specification of Aitek Miner Light hotspot:

For software applications, we have developed a customized Linux system for this project to ensure that the application can run stably, and as an added customized security strategy. The system integrates with a mature online upgrade program, which can ensure system upgrading while operating stably.

### What is this product's model name or model number?
AML-300

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline?
Upon approval, the first batch of delivery will be available in about 1 months.

## Previous shipments
* Have you shipped anything in the past?  Yes,our Helium Fullspots.
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products?
  FCC and CE for Full Hotspots.

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for?

* The radio certificates we are getting is FCC/CE/IC/Nemko/UKCA/WPC.

## Customer Support

We will handle customer service requests via Email and Discord vendor channels, as well as the implementation of the Q&A section on our website. We will provide a one-year warranty on our device. To better serve the community, our team of customer service representatives with technical backgrounds is competent to answer questions and troubleshoot, before and after-sale. We also planned to implant real-time customer support right before our first big container arrived, to help break the stereotype of the lack of customer support in the Blockchain community.

## Hardware Security

These two light hotspots designed for Helium will support ECC chip base on ECC608.  
The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:
* Are you using an ECC608  
Yes
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no?  
Yes we use encrypted chip of ECC608.
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?  
Yes.
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.  
Yes, ECC608 act as encrypted buses with anti-tampering function. We use a customized Linux system as the gateway system, and Linux itself is very secure. Except with ECC608, we also added some additional protections to the system, such as system application encryption, system anti-backflow, and other measurements.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?  
Yes


## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.

* Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.

* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices? This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.

  All OTA updates are automatic and require no manual action by the host. The host is able to change wifi settings.

* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? 

  We use ECC608.

* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway?

  We use SX1302 & SX1250 for the LoRa Modules.

* What is the CPU? 

  Our CPU is Quad-core Cortex-A55.

* Additional Hardware Specifications:

## Manufacturing Information
Our trusted manufacturing partners in China have a complete mass production supply chain of Helium miners. We are capable of producing around 10,000 units per month now and will continue to increase our capacity. Upon approval, our team will be able to mobilize funds and start the mass production ASAP. The finished devices will be then transported to the US, waiting to be dispatched. Additional team members will be hired to support operation work. Our investors and technical expertise will assist us along the way, ensuring smooth production and transportation for the growing demand of Helium miners.

## Proof of Identity
To be submitted privately to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital
We intend to produce 10,000 units per month to meet the current demand and more after the first few batches. We have secured all the capital needed to bring the first batch to market.

## Risks & Challenges
In order to continue our production with our robust supply chain for Helium miners, we aim to secure the stock of critical components beforehand. Despite the remaining impact of a global pandemic such as shortage of chips, transportation delay, etc, We will get through the disturbances and scale production to meet the growing demand.
